# File system base routing

- Next.js uses file-system based routing, meaning you can use folders and files to define routes.

## Simple Explanation

**Folder = URL path**
**page.js = what shows on that page**

Example:
- Folder: `app/dashboard/settings/`
- File: `page.js` (inside that folder)
- URL: `/dashboard/settings`
- Result: The code in `page.js` displays at that URL
